# 🏆 League of Legends Championship Analysis

This repository presents an exploratory data analysis project focused on professional League of Legends (LoL) championship data. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, the project uncovers trends, team statistics, and game strategies that contribute to competitive success in esports tournaments.

---

## 📁 File Description

- `LOL.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all code, data visualizations, and insights from the analysis

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Explore match-level and team-level statistics from recent LoL World Championships
- Identify winning patterns based on team gold, kills, vision score, objectives, and game duration
- Visualize performance differences between winning and losing teams
- Investigate regional or meta differences using statistical summaries and plots

---

## 📈 Key Components

### ✅ Data Processing
- Imported and cleaned raw match and team statistics
- Created derived features like gold per minute, KDA, damage share

### ✅ Visual Analysis
- Used `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, and `pandas` to create:
  - Bar plots of win rates by region
  - Boxplots of team gold differences
  - Correlation heatmaps between objectives and outcomes

### ✅ Insights
- Winning teams tend to:
  - Secure more dragons and towers
  - Have higher vision score and fewer deaths
  - End the game earlier with better map control
